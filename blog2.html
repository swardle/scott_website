                    <p>I have relied my wife’s Seiko eye for design for a while.  She knows how to put things together and what will look good.  She graduated from BCIT in New Media Design & Web Development last summer.  For me the more interesting part is her learning to program but before she could do that she needed to learn PCs and this is that story.</p>
                    <p>She was worked in whole sale beauty supply companies both in Japan and here in Canada.  But whole sale beauty supply companies in Vancouver are small and I feel she wanted to create something.   She wanted a skill she could use anywhere.</p>
                    <p>Seiko didn’t use computers much.  She had an old windows PC that barely ran.  Being around a lot of programmers like me and my friends, Seiko took a course in Java.   Hard core, I thought!  She does not even know how to use a computer let alone program one.   She better study hard!  It didn’t turn out she quit a few weeks later.  I was not surprised most people in her class are people who know python or R or C and want to know what this object-oriented Java programming is like.</p>
                    <p>But she still wanted to create things so she started on New Media Design & Web Development one year full time program.  I warned her that BCIT was a very hard school.  Lots of assignments and people who have graduated from some other school and now wanted to learn a skill where they could get a job fast.</p>
                    <p>Her class mates were the type of people who thought they could make art and use a computer well.  Seiko would always draw me little cute pictures in her notes but this could not make up for her lack of computer skills.  Just before the program started she bought a used MacBook Pro so she would have to learn a new OS too.</p>
                    <p>This was also the first-time Seiko would learn something in English.  She is ESL only having moved here a few years ago so often when we would go over a test or assignment we would find Seiko miss interpreted the question.  It is hard to get the answer right if you don’t understand the requirements.  she had me to help a little, but, oh yeah I am dyslexic and she can already spell better then me already.</p>
                    <p>But Seiko pushed though and did well in her classes.  You can see her work at now at <a href="http://www.seikoigi.com">www.seikoigi.com</a>.</p>
                    <p>In her web classes, she did learn some Java Script… but her skill at this reminded me of how I used to copy programs from magazines.  These days with the web you can do it faster as you don’t have to type it you can just cut and paste or use the plugin.  But this was a area I thought I could help her with.</p>
